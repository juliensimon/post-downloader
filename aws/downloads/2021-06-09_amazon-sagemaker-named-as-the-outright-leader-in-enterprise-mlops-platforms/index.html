   Over the last few years, Machine Learning (ML) has proven its worth in helping organizations increase efficiency and foster innovation. As ML matures, the focus naturally shifts from experimentation to production. ML processes need to be streamlined, standardized, and automated to build, train, deploy, and manage models in a consistent and reliable way. Perennial IT concerns such as security, high availability, scaling, monitoring, and automation also become critical. Great ML models are not going to do much good if they can’t serve fast and accurate predictions to business applications, 24/7 and at any scale.

   In November 2017, we launched
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">
    Amazon SageMaker
   </a>
   to help ML Engineers and Data Scientists not only build the best models, but also operate them efficiently. Striving to give our customers the most comprehensive service, we’ve since then added

    hundreds of features
   </a>
   covering every step of the ML lifecycle, such as data labeling, data preparation, feature engineering, bias detection, AutoML, training, tuning, hosting, explainability, monitoring, and automation. We’ve also integrated these features in our web-based development environment,
