Julien from Arcee introduces a groundbreaking solution to this challenge with Conductor, a new inference platform designed to optimize the selection of language models for any given prompt. Conductor not only streamlines the process of choosing the best model but also ensures that users get the most cost-effective and efficient results.</p><h3 name="f4c2" id="f4c2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What is Conductor?</h3><p name="5d31" id="5d31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Conductor is an innovative inference platform that automatically routes your input prompt to the most suitable model based on a combination of performance metrics and cost. This platform is particularly useful for developers and businesses that need to balance the trade-offs between cost and model capabilities. Conductor supports a diverse range of models, including:</p><p name="dbe2" id="dbe2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">• <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Arcee’s Small Language Models</strong>: These are highly cost-effective and performant models tailored for various tasks such as coding, function calling, and general-purpose language understanding.</p><p name="8600" id="8600" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">External Models</strong>: Conductor also integrates with external models like Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, and some OpenAI models. While these models offer advanced reasoning capabilities and can handle complex questions, they come at a higher cost.</p><figure name="1e72" id="1e72" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-SCHE9Idcs?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><h3 name="f9ea" id="f9ea" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Key Features of Conductor</h3><h3 name="6e32" id="6e32" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3">Automatic Model Selection</h3><p name="f407" id="f407" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">One of the most significant advantages of Conductor is its ability to automatically select the optimal model for each job. This decision is made on a per-prompt basis, taking into account factors such as task complexity, domain, and performance requirements. By doing so, Conductor helps users avoid the common pitfall of either overspending on powerful models for simple tasks or under-delivering on performance by using less capable models for complex tasks.</p><h3 name="48ec" id="48ec" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Cost Efficiency and Performance</h3><p name="53bf" id="53bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Conductor excels in providing cost savings without compromising on performance. For instance, in a live demonstration, Julien showed that a smaller, more cost-effective model could produce answers of comparable quality to a much more expensive model like ChatGPT. In one specific example, ChatGPT was 188 times more expensive than a smaller model, yet the difference in answer quality was negligible. This highlights Conductor’s ability to help users achieve significant cost savings while maintaining high performance.</p><h3 name="1fdb" id="1fdb" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">User Interface and Programmatic Access</h3><p name="baeb" id="baeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Conductor offers a user-friendly interface where you can see a list of available models and their respective performance metrics, including latency, relevance, and price. Users can choose to let Conductor automatically select the best model or manually select a specific model for a task. For those who prefer programmatic access, Conductor supports the OpenAI API, allowing seamless integration into existing workflows. This flexibility ensures that users can leverage Conductor’s capabilities in a way that best suits their needs.</p><h3 name="e816" id="e816" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Live Demonstrations</h3><p name="e43d" id="e43d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Julien’s video includes several live demonstrations that showcase Conductor’s capabilities. In one example, he compares the output of different models for a given prompt, highlighting the trade-offs between cost and performance. The demonstrations also include programmatic examples using the OpenAI API, illustrating how Conductor can be integrated into applications to automatically select the most suitable model for each task.</p><h3 name="c87e" id="c87e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion</h3><p name="6725" id="6725" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Conductor represents a significant advancement in the field of language model inference, offering a solution that optimizes both performance and cost. By automatically selecting the best model for each job, Conductor helps users avoid the compromise of choosing between cost and capabilities. Whether you are a developer looking to integrate AI into your applications or a business aiming to optimize your AI infrastructure, Conductor is a powerful tool that can help you achieve your goals.</p><p name="5068" id="5068" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To get started with Conductor, sign up for Early Access on the <a href="https://www.arcee.ai/book-a-demo" data-href="https://www.arcee.ai/book-a-demo" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arcee website</a>.
