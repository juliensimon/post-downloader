Let’s review all of them and see how much of a free ride we can enjoy.</p><h3 name="9989" id="9989" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Compute — Predictive Auto Scaling</h3><p name="7322" id="7322" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Sizing your compute infrastructure is probably the single hardest thing when building platforms. Capacity planning is a dark art, especially in fast-moving, unpredictable environments like startups. Of course, cloud computing has brought us <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">elastic, on-demand virtual machines</a> that all but completely solve that problem.</p><p name="e206" id="e206" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, there is such a thing as too much infrastructure, and cost needs to be managed as well. For years, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Auto Scaling</a> has helped developers right-size their compute platforms. Still, it’s fair to say that tuning thresholds, alarms and scaling policies became a dark art of its own, as illustrated by this re:Invent breakout session featuring the almighty Netflix.</p><figure name="d4bc" id="d4bc" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PideBMIcwBQ" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="5ec2" id="5ec2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In the spirit of making things simpler, we introduced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-predictive-scaling-for-ec2-powered-by-machine-learning/" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-predictive-scaling-for-ec2-powered-by-machine-learning/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Predictive Auto Scaling</strong></a> at re:Invent 2018.

Says Jeff Barr: “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">This storage class incorporates two access tiers: frequent access and infrequent access. Both access tiers offer the same low latency as the Standard storage class. For a small monitoring and automation fee, S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and moves objects that have not been accessed for 30 consecutive days to the infrequent access tier. If the data is accessed later, it is automatically moved back to the frequent access tier. The bottom line: You save money even under changing access patterns, with no performance impact, no operational overhead, and no retrieval fees</em>”.</p><p name="1811" id="1811" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can learn more about Intelligent Tiering in this re:Invent breakout session, featuring Pinterest.</p><figure name="6917" id="6917" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FEaFuN03g-o?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><h3 name="c35a" id="c35a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Storage — Data Protection</h3><p name="462e" id="462e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Scaling storage is not even half the story: what about making sure that your data stays safe? Of course, S3 provides features like bucket policies, ACLs or encryption to manage and protect your buckets and objects. Here’s a recent deep dive on these topics.</p><figure name="9e86" id="9e86" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vPgXx_zlEx0?feature=oembed" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="eab8" id="eab8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Still, mistakes can happen: incorrect configuration, dropping a sensitive file in the wrong location, making a bucket public, etc. Let’s face it, it’s a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’. When these issues pop up (and boy did they, lately), the only thing that matters is how fast you can detect and fix them: every second counts!</p><p name="62e9" id="62e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To help organizations avoid these issues, we launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/launch-amazon-macie-securing-your-s3-buckets/" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/launch-amazon-macie-securing-your-s3-buckets/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Amazon Macie</strong></a> at re:Invent 2017.
