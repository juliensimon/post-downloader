Cool to see you’re enjoying our new open source project.</p><p id="17b8">You’re asking an excellent (and difficult) question. My mobile days are long gone, but the alternative seems to be:</p><ol class="postList"><li id="20ce">write the same thing three times. Yes, it’s painful, but at least, you get to write the best code for each platform.</li><li id="f0ae">write portable pre-processing code. I don’t think the training environment is a problem here, as you can literally run any language on AWS, and specifically on SageMaker with a custom container. The old fart in me would point you at C / C++, which can run on both mobile platforms. APIs are obviously different, but at least you should be able to get some code reuse… Now, if you also need extra native libraries for pre-processing (image, etc.), this might add extra portability issues.</li><li id="0a67">Offload pre-processing and prediction to a cloud-based API. It all depends on whether you need connectivity at all times, on how much data you have to work with, and on how much latency you can take.</li></ol><p id="8e48">I’m sure you’ve considered all three already. If I had to choose? 3. If unfeasible, 1. Portability is <strong class="markup--p-strong">much</strong> harder than most people think.</p><p id="7b15">Hope this helps.</p></div></div></section>
