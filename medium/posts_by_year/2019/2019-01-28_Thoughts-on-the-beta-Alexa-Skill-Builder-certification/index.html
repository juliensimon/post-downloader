As usual, the exam is first released a beta exam, which you can only take until February 1st. Well, I did take it today (because why not) and although I won’t go into specific details, here are some remarks that may help you prepare.</p><blockquote class="graf--blockquote" id="1d23">A little context first. I felt pretty good about the beta Machine Learning certification that <a class="markup--blockquote-anchor" href="https://medium.com/@julsimon/thoughts-on-the-beta-machine-learning-certification-869a5a469597" target="_blank">I took</a> at re:Invent, because whatever my ML skills are worth, I do spend most of time working on the stuff. Things are different here: my Alexa experience is mostly limited to my <a class="markup--blockquote-anchor" href="https://medium.com/@julsimon/johnny-pi-i-am-your-father-part-7-son-we-need-to-talk-5a910aa642d1" target="_blank">Johnny Pi</a> project, with insufficient attempts at keeping up with the new stuff (screens! screens!) and no real effort to prepare for this exam (because… only 24 hours a day?). That’s probably important in understanding some of the bewildered comments below. That’s also my best excuse for quite likely failing the exam. At least now I know what I don’t know, and you can also thank me for lowering the bar :D</blockquote><figure class="graf-after--blockquote" id="be5a"><img class="graf-image" src="image01.webp"/><figcaption>Nice Echo, oh yesss. We loves it. Why did nasssty Alexa Elves add a screen? Take it off, take it off!</figcaption></figure><p id="9e3f">The exam has 85 questions and lasts for 3 hours (I was done in 90 minutes or so). Here are the topics listed in the exam guide (<a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-alexa-skill-builder-specialty/AWS_Certified_Alexa_Skill_Builder_Specialty_Exam_Guide_v1.0_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>).</p><p id="4b8c"><strong class="markup--p-strong">Domain 1: Voice-First Design Practices and Capabilities (14%)<br/></strong><em class="markup--p-em">1.1 Describe how users interact with skills<br/>1.2 Map features and capabilities to use cases<br/></em><strong class="markup--p-strong">Opinion</strong><em class="markup--p-em">: </em>funny enough, I don’t remember getting a lot of these (?). Blame randomization, I guess.</p><p id="7404"><strong class="markup--p-strong">Domain 2: Skill Design (24%)<br/></strong><em class="markup--p-em">2.1 Design and develop an interaction model<br/>2.2 Design a multi-turn conversation<br/>2.3 Use built-in intents and slots<br/>2.4 Handle unexpected conversational requests or responses<br/>2.5 Design multi-modal skills using one or more service interfaces (for example, audio, video, and gadgets)<br/></em><strong class="markup--p-strong">Opinion</strong>: lots of questions on the interaction model, obviously. Intents, slots (built-in and custom), synonyms, etc. Unsurprisingly, this is the largest domain and you’ll get pounded: <strong class="markup--p-strong">leave no stone unturned on interaction models</strong>. I had several questions on how to deal with misunderstood intents — one of the critical aspects of building a high-performing skill — so you definitely want to be comfortable with <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/post/f6bb7c54-de0d-4abe-98c3-cf3fc75c32f8/how-to-add-fallbackintent-handling-to-your-alexa-skill" target="_blank"><em class="markup--p-em">FallbackIntent</em></a>. Also, <strong class="markup--p-strong">make sure you have experience with screen-based devices such as the Echo Spot</strong>: I got a lot of questions on designing GUI-enabled skills (cards, etc.). Having spent most of my time with Echos and Echo Dots, I really did have a hard time here (and since forever, GUI programming is where I stop). Having said that, I didn’t get any questions on the Alexa Presentation Language, which is probably too new to be featured. Here’s a nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzJ_SHObBMk" target="_blank">re:Invent video</a> if you’re curious.</p><p id="e93f"><strong class="markup--p-strong">Domain 3: Skill Architecture (14%)<br/></strong><em class="markup--p-em">3.1 Identify AWS services for extending Alexa skill functionality (Amazon CloudFront, Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, and Amazon DynamoDB)<br/>3.2 Use AWS Lambda to build Alexa skills<br/>3.3 Follow AWS and Alexa security and privacy best practices<br/></em><strong class="markup--p-strong">Opinion</strong><em class="markup--p-em">: </em>this one’s about connecting your skill to AWS services, so I was back in known territory! I did get questions on all the services mentioned above plus IAM, but <strong class="markup--p-strong">nothing nasty</strong>: newcomers to AWS with a basic understanding of what they do and why they matter in the Alexa context will do just fine. There was a stronger focus on Lambda for obvious reasons, and I’d recommend spending a little more time with the service itself (timeouts, logs, etc.).</p><p id="e644"><strong class="markup--p-strong">Domain 4: Skill Development (20%)<br/></strong><em class="markup--p-em">4.1 Implement in-skill purchasing and Amazon Pay for Alexa Skills<br/>4.2 Use Speech Synthesis Markup Language for expression and MP3 audio<br/>4.3 Implement state management<br/>4.4 Implement Alexa service interfaces (audio player, video player, and screens)<br/>4.5 Parse Alexa JSON requests and provide responses<br/></em><strong class="markup--p-strong">Opinion</strong><em class="markup--p-em">: </em>No Amazon Pay this time, but I did get a few questions on <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/fr/alexa-skills-kit/make-money/in-skill-purchasing" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--p-strong">in-skill purchasing</strong></a> (one-shot and subscriptions). <strong class="markup--p-strong">SSML</strong> popped up too, and my experience with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/ssml.html" target="_blank">Amazon Polly</a> was definitely useful: play with this stuff and know the major features (prosody, etc.). Of course, <strong class="markup--p-strong">state management</strong> is important when you want to build elaborate skills (managing sessions, persisting data to an AWS backend). And yes, I got <strong class="markup--p-strong">code-level GUI questions</strong> (cards, etc.) and I hated every single one of them, although can some of them can definitely be figured out by applying sound judgement.</p><p id="c701"><strong class="markup--p-strong">Domain 5: Test, Validate and Troubleshoot (18%)<br/></strong><em class="markup--p-em">5.1 Debug and troubleshoot using Amazon CloudWatch or other tools<br/>5.2 Use the Alexa developer testing tools<br/>5.3 Perform beta testing<br/>5.4 Troubleshoot errors in the interaction model<br/></em><strong class="markup--p-strong">Opinion</strong>: Lambda, Lambda everywhere! Lots of questions on troubleshooting functions (timeouts, logs, permissions, etc.), so once again spend a time studying the service on its own. Some questions on interaction models with weird/buggy JSON, but if you spend your time writing skills, you’ve probably written much worse (I know I did).</p><p id="adad"><strong class="markup--p-strong">Domain 6: Publishing, Operations, and Lifecycle Management (10%)<br/></strong><em class="markup--p-em">6.1 Describe the skill publishing process<br/>6.2 Add and remove users in the developer console<br/>6.3 Perform analysis of skill analytics in the developer console<br/>6.4 Differentiate among the statuses/versions of skills (for example, In Development, In Certification, and Live)<br/></em><strong class="markup--p-strong">Opinion</strong>:<strong class="markup--p-strong"> </strong>lots of questions on the <strong class="markup--p-strong">skill lifecycle</strong>, which you won’t have fully experience unless you’re really pushed skills to production (review process, updates to live skills, etc.): you should go through this a couple of times, or you’ll be missing some info. A couple of questions on <strong class="markup--p-strong">analytics</strong>, so again, make sure you have a couple of live skills, or at least spend some time studying that part of the console in detail (statistics on intents, occurrences, etc.).</p><p id="d8b4">A couple of blind spots that were not mentioned at all in the exam guide (naughty, naughty): the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--p-strong">ASK CLI</strong></a> (nothing bad, just play with it for a bit) and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-customer-contact-information-for-use-in-your-skill.html" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--p-strong">personalization</strong></a> (accessing customer information, account linking, etc.). This is not unusual for a beta certification, I’d expect the exam guide to be more accurate once the certification is final… and these topics are important, so make sure to study them too.</p><p id="7efc">Overall, I think that the beta exam really hits the target (probably more that the ML exam, which felt a little less polished). I had a miserable time with the screen/GUI questions, but that’s just me: proper skill developers should do just fine, provided that they spend a little time working with backends too.</p><blockquote class="graf--blockquote graf--hasDropCapModel" id="8f62">Trolling aside, why should voice assistants have screens? Seriously? Now I’ve got a proper reason NOT to support that trend ;)</blockquote><p class="graf-after--blockquote" id="aefd">Did you also take the exam? Please share your comments here, but refrain from sharing detailed information as I’ll have to delete it.</p><p id="c9b6">As always, thanks for reading.</p></div></div></section>
