Blame it on dark winter boredom, on accidentally stumbling on that dusty cardboard box in the cellar or on mid-life crisis. Whatever. Some of you out there will get it and I salute you.</p><p id="6814">My interest in UNIX started in early 1992 while studying for my Computer Science engineering degree. <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9my_Card" target="_blank">Rémy Card</a> was teaching the UNIX class, so I got a Linux system running from day 1 :) The first release I installed was 0.13, which then became 0.95 in March ’92 (the first release with X Window support). I still remember downloading the floppy images from <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Cougnenc" target="_blank">René Cougnenc</a>’s BBS (RIP friend).</p><p id="cbb1">Shortly after, Rémy et René et myself co-wrote what it possibly the first magazine article ever published on France on Linux (available <a href="https://fr.slideshare.net/JulienSIMON5/le-systme-linux/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><p id="e53b">There wasn’t a lot of Linux documentation at that time… and none in French. So I started writing my own guide, called “Le Guide du Rootard pour Linux (GRL)”. I also translated the Linux info sheet with some help from René. For a while, these two documents were the only Linux documentation in French (here’s a later <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fr.comp.os.linux/browse_thread/thread/dcde79507580a6c1/c69891b819b5e394?lnk=gst&amp;q=julien+simon#c69891b819b5e394" target="_blank">post</a> from May ’94 in fr.comp.os.linux).</p><p id="d4b4">During that time, I got to meet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank">Linus Torvalds</a> a few times. I also attended the 1st Linux Conference in Heidelberg in ’94 and met <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman" target="_blank">Richard Stallman</a> there.</p><p id="b43f">By then, I had started to work — which meant that I had less time — and I was also growing increasingly annoyed by the business circus surrounding Linux. In May ’95, I decided to stop maintaining the GRL: here’s the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fr.comp.os.linux/browse_thread/thread/9b08a1416dc8c9f1/5ac1921de0994f86?lnk=gst&amp;q=julien+simon#" target="_blank">farewell thread</a> in fr.comp.os.linux, with Rémy saying that I “massively contributed to Linux usage in France”. That was 13 years ago. Man! In late ’96, I somehow found the time to work on a French translation of Kirk McKusick’s 4.4BSD book (see below)… and I swore I would never do it again. This book consumed all my evenings (and many nights) for months. I guess having the privilege to exchange some e-mails with Kirk was worth it all! And then life went on. I’m too young and too alive for a proper eulogy, so this is where I stop :) Without further ado, here’s my UNIX bibliography, with a couple of other OS books thrown in for good measure. I added links to Amazon to for those of you who may want to complete their collection :)</p><figure id="ca01"><img class="graf-image" src="image10.webp"/></figure><p id="3589">1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lions-Commentary-Unix-John/dp/1573980137/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1229191324&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Lions’ commentary on UNIX 6th Edition</a>, by John Lions (written 1977, published 1996)</p><p id="8032">This book is a commented printout of the Unix V6 kernel code.

A very good book that helped me a lot in the early days. If you were working on System V UNIX in the early nineties, this was the one to have.</p><p id="2266">3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Implementation-FreeBSD-Operating-System/dp/0201702452/ref=pd_sim_b_3" target="_blank">The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD UNIX Operating System</a>, by S.

The story has been told many times, but the importance of Berkeley UNIces (4.2, 4.3 &amp; 4.4) cannot be stressed enough, both on a technical and a “philosophical” point of view.

Kogan (published 1992)</p><p id="745e">Not UNIX but still a very good OS, so superior to Windows at the time (remember Windows 3.0???). A dry but very serious book on designing a true multitasking OS for the i386. I learned a lot from this one, especially with OS/2 running on my triple-boot i486.

I used it in ‘94-’96 when I was working on the <a href="http://www.lip6.fr/IBP/Masi.1993.72.html" target="_blank">MASIX</a> project, publishing several papers with Franck Mevel in the process:</p><p id="bf51"><code class="markup--code markup--p-code">- "Overview of the Masix Distributed Operating System", SIPAR Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Systems, Biel-Bienne, Switzerland, 1995</code></p><p id="f86c"><code class="markup--code markup--p-code">- "Distributed communication services in the Masix system", Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Computers and Communications, IEEE, Phoenix, pp 172-178, 1996.</code></p><p id="1b42"><code class="markup--code markup--p-code">- "Secure Communication Services in the Masix Distributed Operating System", Proceedings of the IASTED, NETWORKS, Orlando, pp 5-9, 1996.</code></p><figure id="1067"><img class="graf-image" src="image03.webp"/></figure><p id="dd38">8. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Tools-Third-Shelley-Powers/dp/0596003307/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1229199235&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">UNIX Power Tools</a>, by J.

It has the most complete and clearest descriptions of many complex distributed algorithms (clocks, transactions, etc).

For the first time, this book revealed kernel-level information on SVR4, which was at the core of many commercial UNIces.

The particular interest of this book is that all concepts are with several real-life examples taken from all major UNIces : 4.4BSD, SVR4, Solaris, etc. As far as I know, this was the first book to compare different UNIX versions in such detail.</p><figure id="5e04"><img class="graf-image" src="image16.webp"/></figure><p id="2b53">13. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Implementation-Operating-Addison-Wesley-Systems/dp/0201549794/ref=pd_sim_b_4" target="_blank">The Design and Implementation of the 4.4BSD Operating System</a>, by K.

I don’t think I need another vanilla UNIX book :) Who knows, maybe I’ll actually go and try to pass the certification…</p><p id="79f2">All these books would have been of little use without actual code to work on. A little more exploration in The Vault revealed a cool series of vintage CDs, from a time where broadband didn’t exist and even universities had slow Internet access.
