This mechanism allows the model to access and utilize context from a knowledge base, such as a collection of PDF documents. By retrieving relevant information and providing it to the generative model, RAG can produce more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.</p><h3 id="9462">Arcee Conductor</h3><p id="45fa">One key challenge in building a chatbot is selecting the right model for each query. Different queries may require different levels of complexity and computational power. Arcee Conductor is a model selection service that automatically routes queries to the most suitable model based on the task requirements. This not only improves the quality of the responses but also optimizes the cost of inference.</p><figure id="a0ff"><iframe frameborder="0" height="393" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GSR8Be8TvZw?feature=oembed" width="700"></iframe></figure><h3 id="4b7e">Building the RAG Chatbot</h3><h3 id="9ed8">Setting Up the Environment</h3><p id="f5af">To get started, you’ll need to set up your development environment. The project uses Python and several open-source libraries, including LangChain, Chroma, and Gradio. It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects. The necessary dependencies are listed in the project’s GitLab repository, and you can install them using pip.</p><h3 id="7970">Data Preparation</h3><p id="3195">The first step in building the RAG chatbot is to prepare the data. In this case, the data consists of PDF documents, which can be research articles or any other PDF files of your choice. These documents are stored in a folder, and the chatbot will process them to create a vector store. The vector store is a database of embeddings that represent the content of the documents, allowing the model to retrieve relevant information efficiently.</p><h3 id="bc84">Embedding and Vector Search</h3><p id="5c61">To enable the RAG chatbot to understand and retrieve information from the PDF documents, we use a Hugging Face model for embedding. This model converts the text from the documents into dense vector representations, which are then stored in the vector store. When a query is made, the chatbot retrieves the most relevant document chunks based on these embeddings.</p><h3 id="c786">Orchestration with LangChain</h3><p id="a745">LangChain is a powerful framework for building AI applications. It provides a high-level API for orchestrating the various components of the RAG chatbot, including the embedding model, the vector store, and the generative model. By using LangChain, we can easily create a pipeline that processes the query, retrieves relevant context, and generates a response.</p><h3 id="21e9">User Interface with Gradio</h3><p id="393e">Gradio is a Python library that simplifies the process of building user interfaces for machine learning models. In this project, we use Gradio to create a web-based interface for the RAG chatbot. The interface allows users to input queries, toggle the RAG functionality, and view the generated responses. Additionally, it displays the retrieved context and source documents, providing transparency and trust in the AI’s answers.</p><h3 id="f3e6">Deploying to Hugging Face</h3><p id="7232">Once the chatbot is built and tested locally, it can be deployed as a Hugging Face Space. Hugging Face Spaces provide a platform for hosting and sharing machine learning applications. By deploying the chatbot to a Hugging Face Space, you can make it accessible to a wider audience. The deployment process is straightforward, and the project’s README file includes detailed instructions.</p><h3 id="5960">Demonstration and Results</h3><p id="b82f">To demonstrate the effectiveness of the RAG chatbot, we tested it with several queries. When the RAG functionality is disabled, the chatbot relies solely on the generative model, which often produces generic or incorrect responses. However, when RAG is enabled, the chatbot retrieves relevant context from the PDF documents and generates much more accurate and contextually appropriate answers.</p><p id="b679">For example, when asked about “Arcee Fusion,” a specific model merging technique, the vanilla model produced a vague and incorrect response. In contrast, the RAG-powered chatbot provided a detailed and accurate explanation, citing the main benefits and performance aspects of Arcee Fusion.</p><p id="93d7">Similarly, when asked about the “main innovation of DELLA merging,” the vanilla model produced an out-of-domain response, while the RAG chatbot accurately described the technique and its significance.</p><h3 id="c063">Conclusion</h3><p id="d0b4">Building a RAG chatbot that can query PDF documents opens up new possibilities for accessing and understanding complex, domain-specific information. By combining the strengths of retrieval and generative models, and leveraging a model selection service like Arcee Conductor, we can create chatbots that provide accurate, contextually relevant answers while optimizing performance and cost.</p><p id="0706">If you’re interested in exploring this technology further, we encourage you to:</p><blockquote class="graf--blockquote" id="4627"><em class="markup--blockquote-em">• </em><a class="markup--blockquote-anchor" href="https://www.arcee.ai/book-a-demo" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--blockquote-em">Book a demo</em></a><em class="markup--blockquote-em"> to see Arcee Conductor in action.</em></blockquote><blockquote class="graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote" id="2e33"><em class="markup--blockquote-em">• Watch more videos on our </em><a class="markup--blockquote-anchor" href="https://www.youtube.com/@ArceeAI" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--blockquote-em">YouTube channel</em></a><em class="markup--blockquote-em"> for in-depth tutorials and insights.</em></blockquote><blockquote class="graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote" id="67cb"><em class="markup--blockquote-em">• Follow Arcee AI on </em><a class="markup--blockquote-anchor" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/arcee-ai" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--blockquote-em">LinkedIn</em></a><em class="markup--blockquote-em"> to stay updated on the latest developments and news.</em></blockquote><p class="graf-after--blockquote" id="9254">We’re excited about the potential of RAG and look forward to seeing the innovative applications you will build with these tools.
